## ✅ Before You Start – What You Need

1. **Download Docker Desktop**
   - Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Install it (just like any other app)
   - Open it and let it finish starting up (you'll see a whale icon at the top)

2. **Open Terminal** (Mac) or **Command Prompt** (Windows)
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", hit Enter

3. **Download or Clone This Project** (if you haven't already)
   - You should have a folder with these files

---

## 🎯 Choose Your Computer Type

### **If you have a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, etc.)**

Go to the `Mac (ARM64)` folder

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (Copy-Paste These Commands)

Open your Terminal or Command Prompt and **copy-paste** one of these commands:

### **For Mac (Apple Silicon):**

```bash
cd "Mac (ARM64)"
docker compose up -d
```

Then wait **30-60 seconds** for everything to download and start.

---

## 🌐 Open the Apps

Once the command finishes, open these links in your browser:

- **WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API):** http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- **n8n (Automation):** http://localhost:5678

Done! Both apps are now running. 🎉

## 🛫 Connecting WAHA to n8n (IMPORTANT!)

When you set up WAHA to send webhooks to n8n, you need to use a special address:

### **When you set up WAHA to send webhooks to n8n, you need to use a special address: Inside Waha Dashboard USE:**

```
http://n8n:5678
```

**NOT:**

```
http://localhost:5678
```

Why? In Docker, each app is in its own box. "localhost" means itself, but "n8n"
is the name of the other box. This lets WAHA talk to n8n directly!

**In your browser, you still use:**

```
http://localhost:5678
```

So, when you configure WAHA's webhook or API settings, always use
`http://n8n:5678` to connect to n8n.

## 👨🏻‍🔧 Troubleshooting

### "docker: command not found"

→ You haven't installed Docker Desktop yet. Go install it first (step 1 above).

### "Port 3000 is already in use"

→ You already have WAHA running, or another app is using that port. Kill the old
one first with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Then run `docker compose up -d` again.

### The apps won't load in the browser

→ Wait another 30 seconds, then refresh the page. Sometimes they take time to
start.

### How do I stop it?

→ Run this command in the same folder:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- **Don't close Terminal** – Let it run in the background. The apps keep
  running.
- **Run it in the background** – The `-d` flag means "detached mode" = runs in
  the background
- **Change the ports** – If 3000 or 5678 don't work, edit the
  `docker-compose.yml` file and change the numbers
- **Clear old data** – To start fresh, run:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  ```

## 🎓 What's Running?

- **WAHA** = WhatsApp HTTP API. Connects WhatsApp to the internet.
- **n8n** = Automation tool. Build workflows without coding.

---

## ❓ Still Stuck?

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is **fully started** (check the whale icon)
2. Try the commands again (sometimes copy-paste has issues)
3. Restart your Terminal and try once more
4. Check that you're in the right folder (`Mac (ARM64)` `)
